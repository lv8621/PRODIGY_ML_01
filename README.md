Introduction

In this project, we use a linear regression model to build a predictive model for house prices. Linear regression is a widely used algorithm for regression tasks, and it allows us to understand the relationship between the independent variables (square footage, bedrooms, bathrooms) and the dependent variable (house prices).

Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains historical data of houses with features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and their corresponding sale prices. The dataset is available in the file house_data.csv.

The structure of the dataset is as follows:

SquareFootage	Bedrooms	Bathrooms	Price
1500	3	2	300000
1800	4	3	350000
1200	2	2	250000
2000	4	2	400000
1400	3	1	280000

Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

Clonethis repository to your local machine.
Install the required dependencies by running: pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn.
Usage
To train the linear regression model and predict house prices:

Results

The linear regression model is evaluated using mean squared error (MSE) and R-squared (R2) metrics. The model's performance on the test data is as follows:

Mean Squared Error: 1.5e+7
R-squared: 0.85
These metrics indicate how well the model is performing in predicting house prices.
